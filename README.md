#AScholarsBeard

This tool will pull a user's list of books from Goodreads, using their API, and compare to a predetermined list of book. This will be used eventually to create a numerical indicator. Beards will be assigned based on predetermined score ranges.

Intermediate goal is to assign a simple "Scholar Spirit Animal" to a given range. The final one being John Calvin himself.

Final goal is to apply a beard overlay to an uploaded picture.
